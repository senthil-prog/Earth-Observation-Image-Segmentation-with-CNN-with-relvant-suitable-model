### 1. Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm designed for processing visual data. They're adept at tasks like image recognition by using specialized layers to automatically and hierarchically learn patterns and features from images.

### 2. Land Use Land Cover Classification
Image classification involves categorizing images based on their content, like distinguishing different land use and land cover types (e.g., forests, urban areas) within satellite or aerial imagery.

### 3. Building detection (image segmentation)

Image segmentation focuses on dividing an image into meaningful parts or segments. In the context of building detection, this technique delineates building boundaries within satellite or aerial imagery.
